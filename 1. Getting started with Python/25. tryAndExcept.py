"""In Python, try and except blocks are used to handle exceptions, which are errors detected during execution.
This mechanism allows you to run code that might raise an exception andmanage the error gracefully without 
stopping the entire program."""

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    
except:
    # Code that runs if the exception occurs
